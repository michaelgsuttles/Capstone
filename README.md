# Final Capstone Proposal - Michael Suttles

* What are you trying to do?
Inputting an image of a dog, determine what breed that dog is.
* How has this problem been solved before?
There have been Kaggle competitions to accomplish this goal.
* What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?
I will use images of dogs that are facing forward, and will include a large number of dog breeds.
* Who cares? If you're successful, what will the impact be?
Dog owners will enjoy inputting their dog into the system to see what breed it outputs. It may also help with quick identification in the field if necessary.
* How will you present your work?
I will present my work on GitHub, and possibly on my website.
* Visualization - what final visuals are you aiming to produce?
I will present visuals of dogs and the breed that is output by the system. I may also include some summary statistics.
* What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?
I am scraping Google images for hundreds of dog images for each breed. They are stored in jpg format.
* What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?
The images of dogs are inconsistent--for example, some images have more than one dog pictured. I am manually cleaning the images to delete irrelevant photos.
* What is the next thing you need to work on?
I need to get additional dog breed images and clean the data.
