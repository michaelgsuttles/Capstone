* Classify a dog breed by an uploaded picture
    1.	High level description of project.
    Upload a photo into my app and it returns the most likely dog breed.
    2.	What question or problem are you trying to solve?
    What breed is the dog pictured? Only intended to work for relatively clear pictures of one dog.
    3.	How will you present your work?
        Probably a web app.
    4.	What are your data sources?
        I will scrape Google image search for many pictures of a particular breed of dog to feed into my engine.
    5.	What’s your next step towards making this your project.
        Getting the data
* Look at Twitter data to figure out who loves their dog most
    1.	High level description of project.
        Scrape Twitter through their API and get results for each breed of dog questioned. See what trends there are in the data according to which breed was queried. Filter out images, which will be numerous.
    2.	What question or problem are you trying to solve?
        Which dog breed is the most popular on Twitter, and what are people posting about that breed?
    3.	How will you present your work?
        I will post a web page about the results that includes visualizations.
    4.	What are your data sources?
        Twitter API, list of breeds (already have it).
    5.	What’s your next step towards making this your project.
        Playing with the Twitter API
* Look at NYC voter data and try to combine it with NYC dog registrations to figure out which dogs are Republicans and which are Democrats.
    1.	High level description of project.
        Which dogs are more represented in census tracts that are more Republican, and which for Democrats? Is the relationship statistically significant?
    2.	What question or problem are you trying to solve?
        There isn't enough political news nowadays. Let's politicize dogs.
    3.	How will you present your work?
        I will present a web page with visualizations.
    4.	What are your data sources?
        I already have all the data.
    5.	What’s your next step towards making this your project.
        Work on data cleaning and analysis.
